# AWT_PassEncryptToolkit

**AWT_PassEncryptToolkit** is a Java-based tool designed to securely manage and encrypt passwords using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). This project provides a comprehensive solution for encrypting sensitive information and managing encrypted passwords through a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Overview

The toolkit utilizes advanced encryption algorithms to ensure that sensitive data remains secure. It combines robust encryption techniques with an intuitive AWT-based graphical user interface (GUI), making it suitable for developers, system administrators, and security enthusiasts who need a reliable tool for password management.

## Features

- **Strong Encryption**: Utilizes industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to secure passwords.
- **User Interface**: Features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Usage

- **Encrypt Password**: Follow the GUI prompts to enter and encrypt your passwords.
- **Manage Passwords**: Use the toolkitâ€™s features to organize, retrieve, and manage your encrypted credentials.

## Decrypting Passwords

- **Using the JAR for Decryption**: Once integrated, you can use the toolkit to decrypt passwords as part of your automation tests. The toolkit provides methods for decrypting previously encrypted passwords to verify their correctness and ensure that decryption processes are working as expected.
